Benchmarks for wgpu and pygfx

This repository contains a collection of scripts that perform benchmarks on wgpu and pygfx.
Their purpose include:

* To track performance of pygfx logic, so that the effect of changes on performance can be measured.

Scripts go into the `benchmarks` folder. Matchinhg results go into the `results` folder.
