# Scene-graph traversal: incremental index results

Benchmark: [`benchmarks/bm_scene_index.py`](../../benchmarks/bm_scene_index.py)

These numbers compare the per-render scene-graph traversal cost in pygfx
**before** and **after** the incremental scene-index change (pygfx issue #1298).

* **baseline** — `pygfx/pygfx@main` (`FlatScene` walks the whole tree every render)
* **work** — the `incremental-scene-index` branch (categorization maintained at
  mutation time; `FlatScene` reads flat lists)

The reported figure is the **median of 200 `FlatScene(scene)` constructions**
(pure CPU, no GPU; GC disabled during sampling, 5 warm-up iterations). Lower is
better; *speedup* = baseline / work. Raw output is in the sibling `*.txt` files.

## Takeaways

* The win **scales with scene structure**: flat scenes ~1.1–1.3×, grouped
  scenes ~1.2–1.4×, deeply nested scenes up to **~6.3–6.9×**. Deep graphs benefit
  most because the recursive walk and `group_order` propagation are eliminated.
* The win is **larger on the weaker CPU** across the board (e.g. flat ~1.2–1.3×
  on the i7 vs ~1.1× on the M5; grouped ~1.3–1.4× vs ~1.2–1.3×). On a slow CPU the
  Python scene-walk is a bigger share of frame time, so removing it matters more —
  exactly the embedded / low-power target.
* **Full-render control** (the `@benchmark` functions in the same file) shows no
  measurable change: at realistic sizes a full frame is dominated by GPU
  submission and per-object uniform updates, so the traversal saving is below the
  render noise floor. The optimization pays off for **CPU-bound, scene-graph-heavy
  render loops** (many objects and/or deep hierarchies, weak CPU), not for
  GPU-bound rendering.
